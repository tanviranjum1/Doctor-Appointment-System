# Doctor-Appointment-System
The project is designed to facilitate booking a doctor's appointment, overcoming long wait hours, inefficiencies, and human contact problems. 
The technology is incredibly basic yet effective, promising easy, user-friendly appointment scheduling.
This project was developed using the C++ programming language.
A patient can quickly schedule an appointment with a doctor here. 
He has access to his booking history and a list of doctors that are currently available in the system. The system's administrator can make changes to the doctors.
